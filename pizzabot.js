## **Iteration 7 - Make it visual**
Make the feedback to the customer be printed out on the website instead of just in the console or an alert()

For example, add this message to the website by setting theÂ `innerHTML`Â of an element to be: "Great, I'll get started on your Hawaiian Pizza right away, it will cost 240 kr. The pizzas will take 15 minutes."

Don't forget to create some HTML elements and give them id's to use as selectors in the JavaScript.
