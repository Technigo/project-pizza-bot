# Pizza Bot

The assignment was to create a pizza bot where you choose pizza, how many pizzas and what they will cost. 


## The problem

We used JavaScript to validate the order and to calculate cookingtime and price. Javascript used with css to hide and show elements.

If we had more time we would have done more styling, added pictures and maybe a progress bar.
