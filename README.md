# Pizza Bot
In this weekâ€™s project we coded Pizzabot that is going to ask the costumer what kind of pizza you want and how many of said pizza you want. It will then tell you the cost and how long you will have to wait. 

# The problem
Of the 7 iterations in the project we got stuck on the sixth iteration we were supposed to create functions that would store the name of the pizza, calculate the total cost and the cooking time. Creating the functions went well but we had some issues calling the functions but we managed to solved it after a bit.
