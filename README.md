# Pizza Bot

A pair programming project where we built a pizzabot. 
It will ask you to choose a pizza from the menu, then how many pizzas you want.
It will then tell you the cost of it and how long you can expect to wait. 


## The problem/S

Well, I think we did a really good job with the first JS but then had a really hard time connecting it to HTML and make it visual. 
It's been nice to have Liza with me on this project. I think we work really well toghether.
