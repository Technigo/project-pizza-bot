# Pizza Bot

A pair programming project to practice some basic JavaScript and create a little text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer.

## The problem

We worked as a team and took turns vering the driver and navigator. We mainly focused on creating and executing the javascript and functions, after which we focused on making the website interactive. To make the website more visual we used innerHTML and the .onclick function, and lastly added som CSS. If we had more time, we would focus more on the visual to make the website more interactive for the customer.
