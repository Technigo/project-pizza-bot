# Pizza Bot

A pair programming project to practice some basic JavaScript and create a little text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer.

## The problem

For the project we worked as a team and took turns being the driver and navigator. Our main focus was learning how to use variables, get to know some string methods to modify strings, being able to use conditional statements and write basic functions which take arguments and return values. Therefore, we put most time into creating and executing our javascript functions, after which we focused on making the website interactive. To make the website more visual we used innerHTML and the .onclick function. Lastly we added a background image and some styling to make the site a little nicer. If we had more time, we would focus more on the visual to make the website more interactive for the customer.
