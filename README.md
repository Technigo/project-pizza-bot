# Pizza Bot - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp. Learning objectives:
1. Be comfortable using variables
2. Know some string methods to modify strings
3. Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements
4. Be able to write basic functions which take arguments and return values
5. Connect the JavaScript to show visual feedback in the HTML


# Brief
This weekâ€™s project is to practice some parts of JavaScript you've learned so far to create a little text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer.

You'll do this project as a pair programming project.


## Approach
In our first pair programming session, my partner and I walked through the iterations together. Then we started in on the work of really making the JavaScript visible and converting the alerts to chat bubbles to display in the HTML. Overall it was super helpful to have a partner to work with this week since the assignment felt extra challening. I appreciated having a partner to work through all these puzzles of how to get our little pizza bot to do what we wanted.
