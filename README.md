# Pizza Bot

The pair-programming brief was to create a pizza bot using Javascript.

## The problem

If we hade more time we had made it look more like a bot. We had problems with the connection during our pair-programming session in Visual Studio Code, so we had to work one by one from time to time â€“ and share the code with each other through Git Gist instead. Therefor it is hard to follow the process by looking at the push-updates.
