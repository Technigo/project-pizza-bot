# Pizza Bot
The assignment was to build a pizza bot using javascript. 

## The problem
We started by following the iterations. We used "prompt" and "alert" to build the initial bot. We then used .innerHTML to print the message in the browser. At last we created a form and used javascript to create a submit button that submits the order.

If we had more time we would have started with the black level requriments.
