# Pizza Bot

This project was our first javascript pairprogramming project at Technigo Bootcamp. The scope included usaged of greetings via alert() and prompt() as well as basic javascript functions to check the ordername, calculate cost and cooking time.

## The problem

The main problem was to understand the logic and usuage of the functions and how they work together. We soled the problems by watching many tutorials and google.
