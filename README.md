# üçïüçïüçï Pizza Bot
This week's assignment was to create a text-based bot which one can use to order pizza on one's computer - using html, javascript and css. This was a pair programming project.


## The problem
The main problem was to connect the HTML with JavaScript, and create functions.

We started with the brief and worked our way down and realised we already had made functions before iteration 6 . But then when turning to marking up the html we discovered that our step by step following of the brief was a ‚Äùlinear‚Äù kind of thinking that didn‚Äôt work. We had to basically turn things upside down. We created one last function with our main if-statement and stored and invoked the functions in separate variables to be used in the final message to the user. We got a lot of help to restructure our code from members in the hippo team.


## Struggles
Knowing if variables should be declared outside or inside functions, that is understanding global vs local scope.
Connecting js to html.
Thinking ‚Äùnon-linear‚Äù but still in a certain control flow.
functions- difference between argument and parameters


## Do differently
Spending some more time on understanding the control flow and browser output. To get a clearer picture of the end result and functionality. More in detail, step by step - like: page loads this content, user makes choice, clicks button, makes new choice etc, and connects these steps to what needs to happen in html and js for this to work.

Also trying to better put into words what the code would actually do, what kind of input is needed to do that, what should be put in functions, and what needs to be locally declared vs globally?

Redoing the form in a less static and to a more chat-like function, where the questions get loaded after each answer input. 

Doing some more research on events.
