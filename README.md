# Pizza Bot

We were supposed to work in teams and build a pizza bot. The pizza bot should have three pizzas on the menu that cost 80 SEK each. 

We (Ther√©se & Lillemor) did the blue level.

## The problem

We worked well together and it went fine until Iteration 6, where we got a bit stuck on the functions. We used Google and CodeSandbox trying to solve the problems we had, also we asked a question on Stack Overflow. Since JavaScript is new, I felt it was a challenge to understand first of all the first lines we put in the code, but then also having to change them as we moved along with the Iterations. We did all the requirements for the blue level, and we began trying with the red one. However, we decided in the end to only go for the blue one this time and be happy with that.
