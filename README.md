# Pizza Bot

Week 4 project: to create a simple text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer. This was also done as a pair programming project.  To begin with we had to greet the customer, ask the customer what they want to order and then finalize the order, using variables. Then later on we had to add conditionals and then add functions. The final task was to make the final feedback text appear on the website itself.

## The problem

We started well using prompts to create variables, but then we began to have problems when we started adding the commands to functions. The initial layout of the code was the first obstacle. We found that we couldn't get a function to work, until we released we had to move the function text above the code that was calling that function. We created a button which you click on to start the whole pizza bot process.

As another additional feature, We also created a function to display an image of the chosen pizza alongside the confirmation text.

## View it live

We made the website responsive to make sure it looks good on smaller devices.
