# Pizza Bot

This is our first JavaScript project at Technigo's bootcamp! It's pairprogrammed with @elinaarenstrup. 
The assignment was to create a Pizza Bot that calculates the price and tells the waiting time for the pizza. 

## The problem
The program has three functions. One checks if the pizza is on the menu, the other how much the pizzas cost and the last one how long the wait is. The input is by prompts and the messages are alerts except the last one that writes the information in the HTML by using DOM.
If you type the wrong pizza name it will just say that you have to choose one from the menu, but doesn't redirect to the orignal message which is something for a future update. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
