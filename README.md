# Pizza Bot - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp. 
Practice parts of JavaScript learned thus far to create a little text-based bot which can be used to order pizza on your computer.

Learning objectives:
1. Be comfortable using variables
2. Know some string methods to modify strings
3. Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements
4. Be able to write basic functions which take arguments and return values
5. Connect the JavaScript to show visual feedback in the HTML


## Approach
In our first pair programming session, my partner and I walked through the iterations together. Then we started in on the work of really making the JavaScript visible and converting the alerts to chat bubbles to display in the HTML. Overall it was super helpful to have a partner to work with this week since the assignment felt extra challening. I appreciated having a partner to work through all these puzzles of how to get our little pizza bot to do what we wanted.


## Core Tech
- Pair Programming
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS


## Requirements Completed
 ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
- Work together in a pair, make sure both of you understand what's happening.
- Complete all project iterations.
- Show the final order summary visually by updating the DOM using Javascript.


ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)
- Make an HTML form for the input of the user's name, pizza type, number of pizzas. Choose the form elements that you think fit the purpose best.
<!-- - Show images of the pizza you ordered when you see the final order details.
- Add a few more pizza types and/or different prices for each pizza type -->

âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)
<!-- - Create a progress bar indicating how many steps there are to finish the order.
- Make a little countdown timer that shows up when your order is finished. Starting on 10, 15 or 20 minutes accordingly to the amount of pizzas you ordered.
- Use an array of objects to store the information about the pizzas -->
- Style and structure your HTML/CSS so the user is guided through the ordering process. You could take inspiration from these chatbots: [Kubert](https://cubertbuysphones.com/cubert/), [Milo](https://anartfulscience.com/milo.php)
