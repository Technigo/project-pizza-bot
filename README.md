# Pizza Bot

This is our simple, but kinda cute, pizzabot. It will ask wich pizza you want and how many and will then tell you the cost of it and how long you can expect to wait. 

## The problem/S

Well, I think we did a really good job with the first JS but then had a really hard time connecting it to HTML and make it visual. 
It's been a really hard week and I've been doubtning myself really bad. 
It's been nice to have Liza with me on this project. I think we work really well toghether.
