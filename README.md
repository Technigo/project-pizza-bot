# Pizza Bot

The assignment was to create a pizza-bot uing form and JavaScript in pair-programming.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We followed the 7 steps in the assignment. When our prompts and alerts worked as intended we went on to exchange them with a form. After getting the whole thing to work we did some styling. 

We had a lot of issues with VS Code Live Share, which made the remote work more difficult and time-consuming.
