# Pizza Bot
This was a pair-programming project in week 4 of Technigo Bootcamp. The project was to create a Pizza ordering bot using basic Javascript such as functions, and if/else statment. We were supposed to use the prompt for input from the customer and then alert messages and inner.HTML to respond to the customer.

## The problem
We started programming the prompts and alert messages. When they worked we changed the code so that some of the messages instead showed up in the DOM. After that we created a CSS-file and added some basic styling.
If we had more time on this project we would make it more visual for the customer and make the bot into a form instead of using the prompt and alert messages.
