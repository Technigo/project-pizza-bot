# Pizza Bot
The assignment: through pair-programming create a text-based bot to order pizza online. We had to finish 7 iterations. 

## The problem
We approached the problem through the iterations and started building the JavaScript template straight away. The biggest hurdle was the last iteration, related to making it visual by updating the DOM in JS. In the end we struggled with identifying why 1 of 3 elements only were displayed. Having identified them being defined in the if-statement, it took some more time to get them defined and usable in the general scope. 

Technologies used: Whereby video, Slack chat, Imagecolorpicker, VS Code, GitHub.

If we had more time we would create speech bubbles for the text to be displayed in, “animate” them as a conversation through JavaScript and adjust the colors to reflect the user and/or the bot.
