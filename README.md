# The Pizza Bot!

### This project was made as part of Technigoâ€™s front-end developer boot camp Fall 2020.
In this project, I have created a responsive one-page pizza bot using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## The process and structure
The pizza bot handles user information from a form and with the connection to JavaScript, it shows visual feedback in the HTML. 
Some parts of the form are hidden when opening the initial page and is showed when submitting information to the form. 
To accomplish this, several functions and conditionals were defined. 

If I have had more time I would have

* Made the pizza name input less case sensitive
* Added more pizzas to the menu 
* Made the footer work more smoothly next?

## View it live

The site is deployed [here](https://dazzling-elion-fc6b75.netlify.app/)

Check it out and order a pizza!
