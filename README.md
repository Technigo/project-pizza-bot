# Pizza Bot

This is a project we did while attending the Technigo frontend developer bootcamp. It was a pair programming project. The task was to build a pizza bot using Javascript.

## The problem

We struggled with constructing the functions but we used Stack overflow and asked our team members for help/input.
If we had more time we would add some styling in Css.
