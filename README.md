# Pizza Bot

The assignment was to create a text-based bot that orders pizza.

## The problem

We did one iteration at a time and decided to clean up the code later on with e.g. functions. We decided to create a for loop to iterate over the pizzas on the menu, to make it more dynamic.

If we had more time, we would have added some kind of validation to the quantity input, and styling to the page in general.
