# Pizza Bot

The assignment was to create a pizza-bot uing form and JavaScript in pair-programming.

## The problem


We followed the 7 iterations in the assignment. When our prompts and alerts worked as intended we went on to exchange them with a form. After getting the whole thing to work with taking the users' answer from the input form instead of the prompts we did some styling. We tried to just show one question at a time on the form, but couldn't get it to work at this point in time. Instead, we took the rout to show all questions at once.

We had a lot of issues with VS Code Live Share, which made the remote work more difficult and time-consuming. If we had had more time, the next step would be to add some more input fields to get the user's name and how an image of the ordered pizza on the final order details.
