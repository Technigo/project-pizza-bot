# Pizza Bot
Mission was to make a “Pizza-Bot”, a little text-based bot which you can use to order pizza on your computer. This week we learned and practice JavaScript, variables, functions and conditionals. To finish off the project we connect the JS output to HTML.
But maybe to most important thing in this project is that we do this as a pair-programming project.
## The problem
We (Team Viktoria & Pål) started off by reading the mission brief together. After that we did some deep dive reading about JavaScript.
After forking we then tried to setup VS Code (and later Codesandbox) for team editing but got stuck in technical difficulties. So we went over to Codepen, just to get started and move on. And Whereby as a platform for communication and screen sharing.
Then we actually “talked” our way through this, building and testing the code, step by step, following the mission brief. Whenever we got stuck we went to google, SO and/or demos to get more info.
Later in the project we got VS Code Live Share to work and kept on using that.
We switched seat between writing code and talking code pretty often and it worked perfect!
Working together and to be able to discussion different solutions really helped a lot moving us forward!

If we hade more time we would probably make some rearrangement’s in code and connect it with a HTML form.
And put in a few extra Pizza flavours. :pizza:
