# Pizza Bot

This is a pizza-bot-project. It's a javascript chatbot that helps you order pizza.
It doesn't really order any pizza. Yet.

The project is done by Trang Tran (Tara) and Emelie Svensson.

## The problem

We worked really fast together and managed to do the blue requirements together early. 
We then researched different solutions on the red requirements and reviewed each others code to see what solutions we liked best.

The main problem we had this project was connecting our final pizza-image to show in our final ordermessage.
By talking to each other and researching other teammates solutions we solved it!
